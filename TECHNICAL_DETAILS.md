Starlight Technical Details
==
First and foremost, Starlight is a Vanilla-like light engine. I've seen
some people say it's not, however just because Starlight is fast enough
to defeat typical "light suppressors" does not mean I break Vanilla lighting.
The end result of lighting with Starlight and Vanilla will be the same, and
I have always and will always intend it to be that way. Any lighting difference
between Starlight and Vanilla is considered a bug, unless of course Vanilla
isn't lighting things properly.

This document is intended to clearly outline to programmers
interested why there is such an unbelievable difference in performance
between Starlight and the Vanilla light engine and the existing modifications
(Paper's and Phosphor's specifically) to said light engine. It's also
to highlight the differences between Starlight and Vanilla, and how
they affect Minecraft.


## Light propagation algorithm
In order to discuss light propagation I first need to give a definition
for it. Light propagation is how a light engine takes
a light level, a position, and maybe other parameters, and then
propagates one of two things: An increase in light value to neighbours,
or a decrease in light value to neighbours. Changes to lighting values
in neighbours will then cause said neighbours to queue changes
for their neighbours. Eventually no more changes are queued, which
means the original light change(s) have been "propagated."

While at first glance Vanilla and Starlight seem to propagate
light exactly the same, especially given there are no differences
in the end result, we take entirely different approaches. I'm going
to first outline how Starlight propagates, and then a simplified version
for Vanilla. Why a simplified version for Vanilla? Because Vanilla
has quite a few complexities about propagating light decreases that in some
cases will cause it to eliminate needless updates, however I don't
fully understand how it works, so it is not appropriate for me to explain it. 
However, the simplified variant is good enough to understand key differences between 
Starlight and Vanilla.

This section will be the longest since it's the most
important factor in Starlight's performance uplift.

### Starlight propagation algorithm
Starlight's propagation algorithm is very basic. I designed the entirety
of Starlight around one goal: An extremely fast propagator. Typically
the light engine in Minecraft (even the current light engine) has had _two_ similar
light propagation algorithms: One for block lighting, and one for
sky lighting. Typically the light propagator is responsible for setting up
skylight sources, and typically the block propagator is responsible for
recognizing and propagating block sources.

Starlight only has one light propagation algorithm however. It does
recognize block sources and propagates them, but only when a special
parameter is set (otherwise it would propagate block sources for skylighting,
not good). So how are skylight sources detected and propagated? That is left
to the code using the propagator. The code using the propagator is entirely
responsible for telling the propagator what positions are supposed to be
skylight sources.

Starlight's light propagator algorithm was designed with two very
strict principles: Propagate light changes correctly and have an extremely
low cost per positional update.

Starlight achieved the first goal by using an extremely basic algorithm,
one that's even simpler than the Vanilla algorithm, and even more basic
than even 1.12's light engine.

I'm going to use the case of propagating block light increases to explain
the fundamental algorithm. Light decreases are basically the same except
the algorithm is modified a bit. The propagation is the same, it will
track what level the neighbour should be, but instead of updating
the neighbour to the target level it will do one of two things:
1. If the neighbour's light value is less-than or equal to the
 target value, then it will set the neighbour to 0 and queue
 that neighbour to propagate decreases.
2. If the neighbour's light value is greater-than the target
 value, then it will NOT set the neighbour value and instead
 queue the neighbour for an _increase_, and it must specify
 to the increase algorithm that the neighbour light should be
 checked to make sure it is equal to the level it was queued at 
 (this is to ensure the neighbour doesn't get removed from a later
 decrease and then incorrectly propagated).

If you want far more depth about how decreases work, you can
check out [this blog](https://www.seedofandromeda.com/blogs/29-fast-flood-fill-lighting-in-a-blocky-voxel-game-pt-1).
I personally found it useful as I was struggling to figure out how to
propagate light decreases (specifically, how to perform light updates after 
chunks were lit).


For just increases though, the propagator takes a light value and a position, 
and for all of its neighbours will calculate what that light value would 
be for them given the neighbour opacity. If the new light value is greater, 
then it will update the neighbours light value and then queue that neighbour
to propagate its new light value. The light will propagate in a
BFS manner.

Below is an example of the above algorithm used to propagate increases
in a `World`
```java
class Light {
    queue = ...; // Simple FIFO queue, like ArrayDeque
    // This queue will have hold an object that contains a position and a light value.
    
    
    public void increaseBlockLight(World world, BlockPos pos, int value) {
        if (value < 0 || value > 15) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }
        // assume pos is immutable
        int existingLevel = world.getLightLevel(pos);
        if (existingLevel < value) {
            queue.add(new QueueEntry(pos, value));
            // this is very important: we need to set the light value
            // for positions we add into the queue. the propagator WILL NOT
            // do it for us! Remember, it only sets NEIGHBOUR light values
            world.setLight(pos, value);
            
            // now we can increase
            this.propagateIncrease(world);
        }
    }
    // This is the propagation algorithm
    public void propagateIncrease(World world) {
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            QueueEntry entry = queue.poll();
            BlockPos pos = entry.pos;
            int lightValue = entry.value;
            // iterate through all of the cardinal directions: -x, +x, -y, +y, -z, +z
            for (Direction direction : AXIS_DIRECTIONS) {
                BlockPos neighbourPos = pos.offset(direction);
                // we use max because AIR and maybe others can have opacity 0, which is only useful
                // for the sky light engine. but we don't care here, since we are propagating the sources
                // we were told to.
                int currentLevel = world.getLightLevel(neighbourPos);
                if (currentLevel >= (lightValue - 1)) {
                    // quick short circuit for when the light value is already greater-than where we could set it
                    // this might seem minor but it actually reduces our block get count by 6 times!
                    // this is because it ensures we only can read block state for positions where we 
                    // _could_ set light level, i.e ones we _have not already set_
                    // Since vanilla just recalulates light, this information is lost and it cannot determine
                    // what blocks it has calculated for already...
                    continue;
                }
                BlockState neighbourState = world.getState(neighbourPos);
                int targetLevel = lightValue - Math.max(1, neighbourState.getOpacity(world, neighbourPos));
                if (targetLevel > currentLevel) {
                    // sometimes the neighbour is brighter, maybe it's a source we're propagating.
                    world.setLight(neighbourPos, targetLevel);
                    // now light has been propagated to this neighbour, so
                    // we need to queue this neighbour to propagate to its neighbours
                    queue.add(new QueueEntry(neighbourPos, targetLevel));
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In order to understand why this algorithm is superior to Vanilla's,
I need to explain how Vanilla's even works, at least on a simple level.
Vanilla's is more complicated than I'm about to explain, but I'll show
some real numbers from its algorithms later to show that while
the model I will make for it isn't accurate, it's "good enough" to 
explain the significant difference between how Starlight propagates 
light and Vanilla propagates light.

### Vanilla propagation algorithm

Vanilla's still uses a simple FIFO queue (for explanation purposes),
however instead of trying to propagate light levels to neighbours, it
instead calculates the light level for a queued position FROM its neighbours.
So now propagateIncreases would look something more like this:
```java
class Light {
    queue = ...; // Simple FIFO queue, like ArrayDeque
    // This queue will have hold an object that contains a position. No light
    // value is stored.


    public void increaseBlockLight(World world, BlockPos pos, int value) {
        if (value < 0 || value > 15) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }
        // assume pos is immutable
        int existingLevel = world.getLightLevel(pos);
        if (existingLevel < value) {
            // this is very important: we need to set the light value
            // in the world, and then add the queued values for the NEIGHBOURS.
            // this is because the propagator now uses queued values to 
            // calculate NEW lighting for the position.
            world.setLight(pos, value);

            // queue recalculation for neighbours
            for (Direction direction : AXIS_DIRECTIONS) {
                queue.add(new QueueEntry(pos.offset(direction)));
            }

            // now we can increase
            this.propagateIncrease(world);
        }
    }
    // This is the propagation algorithm
    public void propagateIncrease(World world) {
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            QueueEntry entry = queue.poll();
            BlockPos pos = entry.pos;
            BlockState state = world.getState(pos);
            int lightValue = world.getLightLevel(pos);
            int calculatedLevel = 0;
            // iterate through all of the cardinal directions: -x, +x, -y, +y, -z, +z
            for (Direction direction : AXIS_DIRECTIONS) {
                BlockPos neighbourPos = pos.offset(direction);
                int neighbourLight = world.getLightLevel(neighbourPos);
                // get light from propagating from neighbour into our pos
                int lightFromNeighbour = neighbourLight - Math.max(1, state.getOpacity(world, pos));
                if (lightFromNeighbour > calculatedLevel) {
                    calculatedLevel = lightFromNeighbour;
                }
            }
            // now the new light value is calculated
            if (lightValue < calculatedLevel) {
                // update our light
                world.setLight(pos, calculatedLevel);
                // queue neighbours for recalculation
                for (Direction direction : AXIS_DIRECTIONS) {
                    queue.add(new QueueEntry(pos.offset(direction)));
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
 ```

In practice Vanilla has ordered queues by light level, so it always
processes the highest value queued before any else, but for this
simple example it doesn't matter. It also is far more complicated in its implementation,
and it may not actually read from all neighbours. But for simplicity's sake
we don't need to go over that, this is good enough for a basic comparison.


Like with Starlight, decreases are propagated by modifying the algorithm a bit.
It doesn't change the method, so I'm not going to show it. The skylight
propagator for Vanilla is also the same but has additional checks for determining
if the recalculated block should be a skylight source.

### Propagation comparison

Ok, so why is Starlight's better? It looks like they're both doing
the same thing...

Except they're not. Not even close. Vanilla is doing WAY more getLight/getState calls
than Starlight. Why? Because for each block it updates, it is checking ALL 6
of its neighbours, but for Starlight it only checks JUST ONE (the block it
propagated from). To prove this, I wrote a simple piece of code that
just counted how many calls each light propagator did:
https://gist.github.com/Spottedleaf/583b606a217ed0bdcdd7f9739f8f45b3

Output:
```
Starlight did 24535 getLightLevel calls
Starlight did 4089 setLight calls
Starlight did 4088 getState calls
Vanilla did 171739 getLightLevel calls
Vanilla did 4089 setLight calls
Vanilla did 24534 getState calls
```

`171739` getLight calls vs just `24535`! That's almost `7` times more
calls. On top of that, Starlight reduced our block get calls from `24534`
to just `4088`, a factor of `6`!

This gets even worse when you realise Vanilla must fetch the block state for
each neighbour as well, since it needs that to do additional checks against
collision shape. Starlight avoids this by adding another field into its queued
entry indicating whether the collision shape needs to be checked at all, and
the vast majority of blocks in this game do NOT need conditional shape checks,
so in the vast majority of cases Starlight never does more block reads
than light sets. So adjusting for how Vanilla truly reads block states, it would
be something like this:
```
Vanilla did 171739 getLightLevel calls
Vanilla did 4089 setLight calls
Vanilla did 171738 getState calls
```
Yikes. So Starlight's algorithm reduces light gets by 7 times and
block reads by 6 to 42 times. At least in theory.

While this looks awful for Vanilla in theory, does this really
happen with Vanilla in practice? As I said before, Vanilla's algorithm is far
more complicated than I have shown. So I wrote a test, and here's
the output:
```
Starlight block place
[08:13:41 INFO]: Light gets: 16523
[08:13:41 INFO]: Light sets: 4089
[08:13:41 INFO]: Block gets: 4089

Starlight block remove
[08:14:48 INFO]: Light gets: 20447
[08:14:48 INFO]: Light sets: 4089
[08:14:48 INFO]: Block gets: 4089



Paper light place:
[09:18:13 INFO]: Light gets: 28623
[09:18:13 INFO]: Light sets: 4089
[09:18:13 INFO]: Block gets: 49062

Paper light remove:
[09:18:06 INFO]: Light gets: 152079
[09:18:06 INFO]: Light sets: 4089
[09:18:06 INFO]: Block gets: 181452
```
Here's the diff I used to get the output:
https://gist.github.com/Spottedleaf/b6c366a3314e89f7c36375e554b736b7
Note that diff was applied to Tuinity, because it was far
easier to write it that way (and I can disable/enable the light
engine via config and the same diff will apply).
So technically I am comparing Starlight and Paper's changes, but
Paper doesn't make really any regressions and tests do show
Paper does perform about the same as Vanilla, at least when compared
to Starlight. So I'll be assuming that these numbers would be
exact or similar on Vanilla.

If you apply the diff yourself and want to check my numbers, you need
to entirely disable mob spawning and use a flat world. This is to first
eliminate noise from clogging your console. Secondly, fly out into the sky where 
there is just air around. Finally, set a glass block in the chunk section you're in.
This will prevent both light engines from de-initialising the light in the area,
and force it to actually propagate increases and decreases. Then, in the _same
chunk section_, place a glowstone block. Console should output the results.
Remove the glowstone block. Again console will output the results. You should
ensure the light sets is exactly 4089, otherwise it implies the output was
mixed with noise or wasn't the update you expected.

Both light engines unsurprisingly beat the theory, as there are
more optimisations made. For example, Starlight's propagation
algorithm does not check the light level of the neighbour it propagated
from. That alone wipes out 1/6th of the light get checks. Then, for
processing light level increases, Starlight will not add
light levels greater-than 1 to the queue. Why? Because propagating zero
to neighbours is never going to work - light values are always >= 0.
You can modify the example algorithm I wrote to see how significant that change
really is: from `24535` calls to `19819` calls. A whole 1.2x reduction, just
by adding one if statement. Further, 1/6th gives basically
exactly what we got in our real test. So Starlight's numbers definitely
check out and apply in the real world.

Vanilla really did show quite an improvement over the theory, which was
expected - it's far more complicated in its implementation than the
example I wrote. There's also more to consider as well, since while it
made improvements to light gets in this test, that's not the full story.
The propagator algorithm stores propagated values inside a `Long2ByteMap`,
which is not counted in my test. It's certainly not the case that a read
from that map is going to be faster than a `NibbleArray` read, so there's
definitely hidden costs in this area. Speaking of hidden costs,
Vanilla does quite a few more additional hashtable lookups _per light update_,
which Starlight does NOT do. For example, it needs to a lookup to check
if the block it's about to update is in an initialised section, it needs
to add the updated section to a set of changed sets, and it needs
to do a hashtable lookup/remove per queued value process as the queue
isn't an array based FIFO queue, it's a `LongLinkedOpenHashSet` (this is
because Vanilla can cancel pending light updates).

In any case, Vanilla still fails to come close to Starlight. Comparing
the block reads in the real test for increases shows Starlight did 12x less, and
it did _at least_ 1.7 less light level reads (although see the above paragraph
for why Vanilla probably did more). For decreases, Starlight did _44_ times less
block reads and _at least_ 7.4 times less light gets. Again, there is
additional logic not covered by these numbers in the Vanilla light engine.

Ok, but do these numbers really matter for light propagation?

I wrote in additional code to lightbench (v1.0.1) that would time light 
updates on the client and print the timings to sysout if
the light engine performed any updates. I decided to test
2 cases: Light updates at = 254 and simple glowstone 
placing/removal. I used a world that generated grass at y = 254 and
bedrock at y = 0 to test this. Once again, you need to disable mob spawning
to prevent noise from mobs updating blocks. Locally I just joined my local
Tuinity server and configured server.properties to not spawn any mobs.

Here are the raw timings for the tests I did:
https://gist.github.com/Spottedleaf/84cfa932828a3459cf1e2a95dc1f2cf5

Tested versions:
- Vanilla Minecraft 1.16.5
- Phosphor 0.7.1
- Starlight 1.0.0-RC1

Hardware:
- Ryzen 9 5950X
- GTX 750 Ti

The graphs:
Below is a graph for block updates that occurred on the grass platform
at y = 254, the light updates had to propagate down to y = 0 where
the bedrock platform was at.
![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/kKtbe9y.png)

Below is a graph for placing a glowstone block on top of the bedrock platform
(so that skylight had zero effect)
![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/yCNK602.png)

Unsurprisingly Starlight propagated the changes the fastest, as these
are pure light update propagation tests. This also proves that Starlight's
propagation algorithm is indeed faster than Vanilla's, and it is faster
by _a lot_. It is ~28 times faster than Vanilla in the glowstone remove test
and is ~12 times faster than Vanilla in the glowstone place test.
Starlight is also ~13 times faster at the block remove at y = 254 test
and ~37 times faster than the block place test at y = 254 than Vanilla. So
Starlight is consistently faster than Vanilla in pure light propagation
tests.

Effectively, Starlight's propagation algorithm is extremely fast. Much
faster than Vanilla's, and the theory behind it certainly backs it up.
It is doing significantly less logic per light update, so while it might
be dumber and do more light updates total in some cases, it has more
than enough margin to do the additional wasteful updates and _still_
beat Vanilla.

## Light data management
In 1.14 the Vanilla light engine made very significant performance improvements
to light updates at extreme heights. They managed to do this by realising
that in a lot of cases, light data was actually redundant and identical to sections
below and above. Take for example a world with grass at y = 254 and bedrock
at y = 0. Only the light around the top and the bottom of the world
actually matter - the sections inbetween will actually always be the same.

The general rule imposed is that only light data (nibblearrays) that exists within 1 square
radius (`max(abs(x2 - x1), abs(y2 - y1), abs(z2 - z1))`) of a non-empty
chunk section is going to be initialised - no other light data will exist.
If a section turns empty, then the surrounding data is possibly removed to
comply with this rule. For skylighting, this is a pretty big gain. No longer
does lighting need to be propagated fully from y 255 down to y 0 - just only
in the sections that exist.

Starlight adheres to these rules and properly propagates skylight through
sections, even if they don't exist - just like Vanilla. I've also chosen
to document this behavior because it is by far the most complicated
aspect of the new light engine principles, and it is critical to understand
this principle to understand how lighting should work in modern Minecraft.

## Chunk lighting algorithms
The next important case to consider is chunk lighting. Starlight and Vanilla
do block chunk lighting basically the same; we iterate over the light sources in
the chunk and shove them into the light propagator algorithm. Then,
an edge check is performed to bring in light from neighbours. Edge checks
are rather simple: does the light value for the position match up with what
its neighbours say it should be? If not, they need to be checked as if
the block was changed. Given the logic we do is basically the same,
I don't expect any special improvements to come from block chunk lighting
other than the faster propagation algorithm. So I'm not going to go any
further on it.

Skylight is a different story. Like I referenced earlier, the light propagator
algorithm in Starlight does not set up light sources, unlike Vanilla's.

### Skylighting in Starlight
Starlight will simply start from one block above the highest non-empty
chunk section and try to "propagate" skylight downwards. The logic is
fairly simple, skylight source can propagate through a block if its
opacity is 0 (like air or glass) and the block is not conditionally
opaque (does it need to check its shape to see if lighting can pass) in
the +y direction on the block. From there it will just shove all the
lighting sources into the light propagator algorithm and run it.

Starlight sets up light sources very efficiently on Fabric though. Instead of
actually iterating from top down and reading the blocks, it creates and
uses a bitset stored on the chunk sections themselves to note what blocks
are guaranteed opacity 0. So it can determine and use a heightmap for setting
up sources. Starlight's light propagator can also be told for a given
queued entry what neighbours it should check, and of course you can
use the heightmap to figure out what neighbours are going to be level
15 so you can exclude checking them, and in most cases exclude
even queueing the position. For example, for lighting a desert
(just flat terrain, mostly) I noticed the queued levels to propagate
were only about ~300, whereas on the Tuinity implementation they could
be ~2000 or more. There was real benchmarking decisions behind making
these changes. Tux did some async profiling for me, and showed me these results:

![Profiling Results 1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/712294045312876586/772876777189802014/Screenshot_from_2020-11-02_12-35-57.png)
![Profiling Results 2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/712294045312876586/772877803523145738/Screenshot_from_2020-11-02_12-40-01.png)

You'll notice significant time (about ~12%) is spent setting reading blocks
from the chunks setting up skylight sources. However, only 4% of the time is
actually spent reading blocks while propagating light, and a whooping 27% of
time was spent reading light levels for propagating light. This
very significant difference made me think that most of the queued values
were simply not propagating light at all, since their neighbours were most
likely full 15 as well.

Effectively all the changes come down to the fact that Starlight needs to
manually setup light sources, and of course by manually setting them up
optimisations can be made. Instead of relying on the propagator, which is
going to have to do additional block reads and light reads, it can
simply do the minimum number of block reads per chunk. On Fabric, it
can avoid block reads entirely.

### Skylighting in Vanilla
Skylighting in Vanilla is all done via the light propagator algorithm. So
where does it start? It starts by edge checking all the light data
in the chunk (initially its all level 0. It's also guaranteed there is a light
data section above the highest non-empty section in the chunk due to the
light data management).

To explain how that procedure even lights a chunk:
It might be hard to think about, but the edge checks on the light data
above the highest non-empty section will eventually turn that light data
section into full 15 which will then propagate into the sections below. So
while it's not as straightforward to see as Starlight, it gets the job done.

### Chunk lighting algorithm comparison

Why might this approach be worse than Starlight? This is because
by iterating downwards from above explicitly I will always do the minimum
number of block gets (no light value reads) and light value set calls to
initialise the skylight sources in the chunk. Meanwhile, Vanilla has to
use the inefficient propagator to do it. So while it might not seem
like a lot, typically chunk sections are only going to ever need two or three
sections worth of light propagations to become lit - but adding on
an extra section for isn't very efficient.

Vanilla will also propagate skylight into chunks that are not lit. So it's also
going to do light propagations that will be later overwritten. Starlight will
not propagate into unlit chunks. This is a concern only for writing data to
disk, but this is covered later.

Starlight in this case doesn't really make insane improvements on chunk lighting
compared to Vanilla, but it does make improvements and does do it differently
than Vanilla. However, the end result in terms of light is going to be the same.

To show the performance difference between Starlight and Vanilla for
chunk light generation, I wrote a simple tool to test it here:
https://github.com/Spottedleaf/lightbench

Please note that when comparing these results from the old Starlight README
and now that I've completely switched systems. Back then I ran an i9-8750H processor

## Other Benchmarks

For reference, here are a bunch of comparisons I made back around January 2021.
Note that the explanations and summary of comparisons is included in each
video's description. Please note, my CPU specs have since changed from January, 
back then I ran an i9-8750H processor locked at 2.2GHz (turbo disabled), and
now I have a Ryzen 9 5950X. So please be aware of that when comparing 
the old benchmarks I've done and the new. Description for each video
will say what version of software was tested.

In summary, Starlight significantly reduced the amount
of time to generate the world. 

[MC-162253](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-162253):

In summary, Starlight significantly reduced the amount
of time to generate the world. It generated in almost
the same time as the standard world gen, just 3 seconds
longer.

In summary Starlight basically eliminated the massive frame stall
from the piston causing the light update at max world height.

This about concludes the major improvements Starlight does to the light engine.
I make very small improvements everywhere else in the light engine (i.e the light
propagator algorithm is very optimised), but this document isn't supposed
to go line-by-line of Starlight, just the major points.

# Important Details to Note

## Chunk Save Format

You might have noticed Starlight modifies the format of light on disk.
It does this for two reasons: It needs to store whether a skylight data
section is uninitialised or absent (Vanilla conflates the two) and
Starlight does not propagate light into chunks not marked as lit. However,
in modifying the data stored, it also marks the chunk as "unlit." and add
its own special tag for whether the chunk is it. To Vanilla the data will look
like the chunk needs lighting, and to Starlight it will look "lit." So
the world save format is compatible if saved in Starlight, as it will force
Vanilla to relight the chunk. If the world is saved in Vanilla then
to Starlight the chunks will look unlit, so it will relight them.
Therefore, lighting will not break going from Starlight to Vanilla or
from Vanilla to Starlight.

## FPS Impact

### Block changes
The amount of time to propagate lighting is pretty minimal except for
high altitude scenarios. However, most people aren't up that high, so
I don't expect any changes Starlight does to actually make FPS improve
on the average - it just helps with those edge cases at maximum world
heights.

### Faster Chunk Loading and Generation
While it might seem that faster chunk loading/generation is only a good thing,
it really isn't in all cases. For example, the amplified world gen test showed
this. Chunk gen was considerably faster, however: The video clearly shows the
client is stuttering a lot more! As expected, when you throw more chunks
at the client, and then combine it with Mojang's top tier rendering code,
you get a bottleneck. Stuttering is no fun, probably much better on the
user end to just have chunks load slower if it means their FPS stays
smooth.

There's no reason the client cannot be simply improved to
simply limit the amount of chunks it tries to render per frame. As it stands,
it's not really doing that, so this problem will happen more on Starlight. So
while it's not technically my fault, it will happen more with MY changes, so
it should be noted.

However, if the client sided problems are resolved, it would mean having
larger world heights in terrain generation can be achieved without sacrificing
significant performance. Especially now with Minecraft looking to
change world height limits.

### Conclusion of changes to FPS

So overall I do not expect Starlight to improve FPS at all. If anything, it
will harm it due to the stuttering caused by generating and loading chunks faster.

## Mod Compatibility
Unsurprisingly a cutting edge change to Minecraft initially designed for
Bukkit-based servers has mod compatibility problems on platforms like
Forge and Fabric. Any mod that relies on hooking directly into the
light engine will be broken by Starlight, since Starlight is a complete
rewrite of the engine. You can find an active list of broken mods here:
https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Starlight/issues

The above issue tracker of course is not 100% complete, as it relies on
people reporting those issues there - and given it's unlikely I will
ever fix the incompatibilities, I wouldn't expect many people to even bother
reporting.

# Conclusion

Starlight is the fastest light engine implementation in Minecraft currently.
However, that has not come without its price. It will break some mods, and reveals 
some stuttering problems on the client. So which light engine should you use?
I would personally recommend against using Vanilla at the minimum, since 
Phosphor is a proven improvement, and it fixes performance problems 
like MC-162253. So it comes down to Phosphor or Starlight. In terms of 
mod compatibility, Phosphor is going to be better since it modifies the
light engine. Depending on your computer though, and terrain, you might just end up
seeing more stutters on Starlight. So it depends, I would personally recommend 
testing both. 

This recommendation changes for larger scale (player wise) servers, however. 
Larger scale servers are going to suffer more often because of how slow
the light engine is. If the light engine falls behind for any reason and
continues to fall behind, and the server is restarted, then pending light
updates are lost and can cause broken lighting. Starlight fixes this
by first being faster and so very unlikely to fall behind, and secondly
by preventing chunks from saved when they have pending light updates. Larger
scale servers also have more people exploring, which is going to put a higher
stress on chunk generation, which Starlight will help with.

So I would personally bet for a performant Minecraft experience, Starlight
will handle large scale servers the best, and depending on various factors
(see first paragraph) Phosphor might be better for small scale and singleplayer.
For more modded experiences, double check that your mods are compatible.
